# Gearbox_Project
### This is a group project of a gear reduction system, The system consist of three shafts: Input, Intermediate and Output Shaft, Two pinions and two gears, all helical, with a gear reduction ratio of 1:16. The shafts are supported by appropriate bearings, A outer shell were also constructed for convering the inner components.
#### All the mathmatical calculations were performed using MATLAB
#### The prototype were modelled using Solidworks
#### Detailed engineering drawing were generated by Solidworks
#### Some hand-drawn graphs are available on design report
##### Group Effort
